# 🧠 Magic Root Network Automation Tool

**CLI-based Network Infrastructure Provisioning & Security Hardening Framework** that standardizes enterprise device initialization, subnet planning, and automation-driven network engineering workflows.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
To build a structured, secure, and scalable network provisioning framework that standardizes how network devices are initialized, hardened, and prepared for deployment in enterprise environments.

Magic Root models real operational network engineering workflows, not just lab configuration.

---

## 🏗 Architecture
The system follows a modular CLI-driven architecture:
